## <center> Emerging Interconnects Technologies for Network-on-Chips </center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
There is a shift from multi-core to many-core architectures containing hundreds to a thousand
cores on a single chip. However, traditional on-chip metallic interconnects require excessive
power as technology keeps scaling and will not be able to provide communication support for
manycore architectures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Moreover, fundamental signaling limitations (reflections, crosstalk),
electromagnetic interference (EMI), clock skew, and other problems associated with metallic
interconnects will only exacerbate the power dissipation problem and thereby limit the
performance of future manycore processors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Emerging interconnect technologies such as silicon-photonics and wireless interconnects are
under serious consideration for meeting the manycore communication requirements. However,
the use of a single interconnect technology is not sufficient to provide satisfactory
performance. Silicon photonic on-chip interconnects offer low latency, low power consumption,
and high bandwidth for on-chip communication. But, they suffer from scalability difficulties and
high optical power loss (insertion loss) when scaled to thousands of cores. On the other hand,
on-chip wireless interconnects have the advantages of distance-independent energy
consumption. But, limited frequency spectrum and higher energy/bit limit the use of wireless
technology.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this project we are leveraging the advantages of both wireless and photonic
technologies, and exploring a network-on- chip called OWN (Optical Wireless Network)
architecture for many-core systems. We are designing silicon photonic links for communication
among the neighboring cores in a cluster of tiles with relatively short distances, and
reconfigurable wireless links for inter-cluster while for inter-cluster communications and long
distances on the chip.
