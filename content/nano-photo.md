As power dissipation in future Networks-on-Chips (NoCs) is projected to be a major bottleneck, researchers are actively engaged in developing alternate power-efficient technology solutions. Photonic interconnects is a disruptive technology solution that is capable of delivering the communication bandwidth at low power dissipation when the number of cores is scaled to large numbers. Similarly, 3D stacking is another interconnect technology solution that can lead to low energy/bit for communication. In this paper we propose to combine photonic interconnects with 3D stacking to develop a scalable, reconfigurable, power-efficient and high-performance interconnect for future many-core systems, called R-3PO (Reconfigurable 3DPhotonic Networks-on-Chip). We propose to develop a multi-layer photonic interconnect that can dynamically reconfigure without system intervention and allocate channel bandwidth from less utilized links to more utilized communication links. In addition to improving performance, reconfiguration can re-allocate bandwidth around faulty channels, thereby increasing the resiliency of the architecture and gracefully degrading performance. For 64-core reconfigured network, our simulation results indicate that the performance can be further improved by 10%-25% for Splash-2, PARSEC and SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks, where as simulation results for 256-core chip indicate a performance improvement of more than 25% while saving 6%-36% energy when compared to state-of-the-art on-chip electrical and optical networks.

The power dissipation of metallic interconnects in future multicore architectures is projected to be a major bottleneck as we scale to sub-nanometer regime. This has motivated researchers to develop alternate power-efficient technology solutions to the performance limitations of future multicores. Nanophotonic interconnects (NIs) is a disruptive technology solution that is capable of delivering the communication bandwidth at low power dissipation when the number of cores is scaled to large numbers. Similarly, 3D stacking is another interconnect technology solution that can lead to low energy/bit for communication. In this paper, we propose to combine NIs with with 3D stacking to develop a scalable, reconfigurable, powerefficient and high-performance interconnect for future many-core systems called 3D-NoC. We propose to develop a multi-layer NIs that can dynamically reconfigure without system intervention and allocate channel bandwidth from less utilized links to more utilized communication links. Our simulation results indicate that the performance can be further improved by 10%-25% for Splash-2, PARSEC and SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks.

Multi-core chips or chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are becoming the de facto architecture for scaling up performance and taking advantage of the increasing transistor count on the chip within reasonable power consumption levels. The projected increase in the number of cores in future CMPs is putting stringent demands on the design of the on-chip network (or network-on-chip, NOC). Nanophotonic interconnects have recently emerged as a viable alternate technology solution for the design of NOC because of their higher communication bandwidth, much reduced power consumption and wiring simplification. Several photonic NOC approaches have recently been proposed. A common feature of almost all of these approaches is the integration of the entire optical network onto a single silicon waveguide layer. However, keeping the entire network on a single layer has a serious implication for power losses and design complexity due to the large amount of waveguide crossings. In this paper, we propose MPNOC: a multilayer photonic networks-on-chip. MPNOC combines the recent advances in silicon photonics and three-dimensional (3D) stacking technology with architectural innovations in an integrated architecture that provides ample bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficient on-chip communications for future CMPs. Simulation results show MPNOC can achieve 81.92 TFLOP/s peak bandwidth and an energy savings up to 23% compared to other proposed planar photonic NOC architectures.
