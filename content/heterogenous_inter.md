As throughput, scalability, and energy efficiency in network-on-chips (NoCs) are becoming critical, there is a growing impetus to explore emerging technologies for implementing NoCs in future multicore and many-core architectures. Two disruptive technologies on the horizon are nanophotonic interconnects (NIs) and 3D stacking. NIs can deliver high on-chip bandwidth while delivering low energy/bit, thereby providing a reasonable performance-per-watt in the future. Three-dimensional stacking can reduce the interconnect distance and increase the bandwidth density by incorporating multiple communication layers. In this paper, we propose an architecture that combines NIs and 3D stacking to design an energy-efficient and reconfigurable NoC. We quantitatively compare the hardware complexity of the proposed topology to other nanophotonic networks in terms of hop count, network diameter, radix, and photonic parameters. To maximize performance, we also propose an efficient reconfiguration algorithm that dynamically reallocates channel bandwidth by adapting to traffic fluctuations. For 64-core reconfigured network, our simulation results indicate that the execution time can be reduced up to 25 percent for Splash-2, PARSEC, and SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks. Moreover, for a 256-core version of the proposed architecture, our simulation results indicate a throughput improvement of more than 25 percent and energy savings of 23 percent on synthetic traffic when compared to competitive on-chip electrical and optical networks.

Multi-core chips or chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are becoming the de facto architecture for scaling up performance and taking advantage of the increasing transistor count on the chip within reasonable power consumption levels. The projected increase in the number of cores in future CMPs is putting stringent demands on the design of the on-chip network (or network-on-chip, NOC). Nanophotonic interconnects have recently emerged as a viable alternate technology solution for the design of NOC because of their higher communication bandwidth, much reduced power consumption and wiring simplification. Several photonic NOC approaches have recently been proposed. A common feature of almost all of these approaches is the integration of the entire optical network onto a single silicon waveguide layer. However, keeping the entire network on a single layer has a serious implication for power losses and design complexity due to the large amount of waveguide crossings. In this paper, we propose MPNOC: a multilayer photonic networks-on-chip. MPNOC combines the recent advances in silicon photonics and three-dimensional (3D) stacking technology with architectural innovations in an integrated architecture that provides ample bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficient on-chip communications for future CMPs. Simulation results show MPNOC can achieve 81.92 TFLOP/s peak bandwidth and an energy savings up to 23% compared to other proposed planar photonic NOC architectures.
