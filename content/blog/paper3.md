Professor Ahmed Louri and his research team (S. V. Winkle, A. Kodi, R. Bunescu and A. Louri) have published a conference paper that explores machine learning to extend the power-efficieny and performance of photonic interconnects for heterogeneous multicores. The paper titled “Extending the Power-Efficiency and Performance of Photonic Interconnects for Heterogeneous Multicores with Machine Learning,” will appear in Proceedings of the 24th IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, Feb. 24-28, 2018, Vienna. HPCA provides a high-quality forum for scientists and engineers to present their latest research findings in this rapindly-changing field. This research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation.
