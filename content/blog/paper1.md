Professor Ahmed Louri and his research team (M. Clark, A. Kodi, R. Bunescu and A. Louri) have published a conference paper that explores learning-enabled, energy-aware dynamic voltage and frequency scaling in NOCs. The paper titled "LEAD: Learning-Enabled Energy-Aware Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Scaling in NoCs," will appear in Proceedings of the 55th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC), June 24-28, 2018, San Francisco, CA. DAC is the world's premier EDA and semiconductor design conference and exhibition. This research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation.
