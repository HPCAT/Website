Professor Ahmed Louri and his research team (A. Kodi, K. Shiflett, S. Kaya, S. Laha and A. Louri) conference paper that explores power-efficient, kilo-core, photonic-wireless, hybrid Network-on-Chips was accepted. The paper titled "Power-Efficient Kilo-Core Photonic-Wireless Hybrid NoCs,” will appear in Proceedings of the 32nd IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), May 21-25, 2018, Vancouver, BC. IPDPS is an international forum for engineers and scientists from around the world to present their latest research findings in all aspects of parallel computation. This research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation.
